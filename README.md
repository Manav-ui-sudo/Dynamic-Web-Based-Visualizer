CPU Scheduling Visualizer | C++ Project

Simulated core CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SRTF, Round Robin) with real-time Gantt chart visualization

Parsed process data from external input files and implemented time-tracking, turnaround, and CPU utilization metrics

Developed an interactive system mimicking OS-level process handling for educational and demonstration purposes
